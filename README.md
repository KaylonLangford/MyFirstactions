What will I do 
Today, I will work on my project and do better on it every day. Therefore, I can know more about what I do as I continue my education and learn more. This will bring me some where out of life. When I make it to where I want to be, I will congradulate myself for working hard to get to where I am. Therefore, I thank Git hub for helping me to achieve this momnet in life because I was down before I reched to the top. Now I've reached glory.
